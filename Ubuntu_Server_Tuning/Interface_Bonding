Explanations: 
Yes, the provided configuration appears to be a Netplan configuration file written in YAML format. It defines a network configuration with a bonded interface (bond0) consisting of three physical interfaces (enp35s0, enp36s0, and enp18s0f0). Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

bond0: Defines a bonded interface with the specified IP address and CIDR notation. It includes a list of physical interfaces (enp35s0, enp36s0, enp18s0f0) to be part of the bond.

addresses: Specifies the IP address and CIDR notation for the bonded interface.
interfaces: Lists the physical interfaces that will be part of the bond.
nameservers: Specifies DNS resolver information, including the addresses of DNS servers (1.1.1.1) and a search domain (limda.net).
parameters: Additional parameters for the bond configuration, including mii-monitor-interval, mode, and transmit-hash-policy.
routes: Configures a default route with the specified gateway.
ethernets: Defines individual configurations for each physical interface (enp35s0, enp36s0, enp18s0f0).

For each physical interface, dhcp4 and dhcp6 are set to false, indicating that DHCP is disabled for IPv4 and IPv6.
version: Specifies the Netplan configuration version, which is set to 2.

Make sure to replace <ip>, <cidr>, and <gateway> with your actual IP address, CIDR notation, and gateway information, respectively. Additionally, adjust other settings based on your network requirements.



Below is the configuration of /etc/network/interface 
===========================================================


Certainly! Below is the equivalent configuration for the /etc/network/interfaces file:

# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'

auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
  address <ip>/<cidr>
  bond-slaves enp35s0 enp36s0 enp18s0f0
  bond-mode 802.3ad
  bond-miimon 100
  bond-xmit-hash-policy layer2+3
  gateway <gateway>

  dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1
  dns-search limda.net

iface enp35s0 inet manual
  bond-master bond0

iface enp36s0 inet manual
  bond-master bond0

iface enp18s0f0 inet manual
  bond-master bond0

Replace <ip>, <cidr>, and <gateway> with your actual IP address, CIDR notation, and gateway information, respectively. Adjust other settings as needed for your network configuration. Keep in mind that the /etc/network/interfaces file is specific to Debian-based systems, and other distributions may use different network configuration files or tools.


Example:

cat /etc/network/interfaces
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
